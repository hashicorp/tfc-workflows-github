## About

These templates use individual custom Docker GitHub Actions that interact with Terraform Cloud API's rather than the traditional Terraform CLI.

The core tooling is a containerized go application, designed to work with GitHub Actions, GitLab Pipelines, and more in the future.

## Starter Workflow Templates

* [Terraform Speculative Run (Pull Request Open/Edit Workflow)](https://github.com/hashicorp/tfc-workflows-github/blob/main/workflow-templates/terraform-cloud.speculative-run.workflow.yml): Workflow to run non-applyable speculative runs in Terraform Cloud when a pull request has been opened/modified.
* [Terraform Apply Run (Push to main branch/PR Merge to main Workflow)](https://github.com/hashicorp/tfc-workflows-github/blob/main/workflow-templates/terraform-cloud.apply-run.workflow.yml): Workflow to perform an apply run for a given workspace.
